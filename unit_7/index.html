				<h3>Sample Post</h3>
				<p class="small_font">April 17, 2017</p>
				<br>
				<div class="left_align">
					<p>This is a sample post to have a post visible on the page. It's not a real post. But when I have real posts, I will write about real things. Sometimes life, sometimes work, sometimes books. A mixture of reflections and project showcasing and whatever I want. Because this is my website. I made it, and so I get to choose.</p>
					<br>
					<p>So thanks for reading my sample post. This will be better once I have a CSM in place. Currently soliciting your thoughts on the best way to incorporate photos. A sidebar? Inline with the text? Thanks.</p>

				<h2>SERVICES</h2>
				<div class="left_align">
					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>Specializing in web design and logo design, I'm available for hire for your web and branding projects. Take a look at my <a href="#" class="p_link">portfolio</a> below, and don't hesitate to <a href="#" class="p_link">contact</a> me with specific information about your request.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Photography</h3>
					<p>Tired of using stock photos or low-res images on your website? Let's upgrade that. Using high-quality images can revolutionize a website. If you need more than basic web design, we can work together to get you the best photos for your brand. To get a sense of my photography work, look at my <a href="#" class="p_link">portfolio</a> and around this website. Every picture I'm not in was taken by me.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Content Collaboration</h3>
					<p>With a background in content marketing, I understand that good content is hard to come by. It takes time, knowledge, and skill to craft the right messaging. You can get a sense of my writing from the <a href="#" class="p_link">blog</a>, but if you're looking for a freelance content writer, <a href="#" class="p_link">contact</a> me for specific information as well as sample work.</p>

					<p>I'm Sarah, a Chicago native now based in the DC area. I love writing, words, stories, and books. Libraries full of them. Welcome to my little nook, centered around telling stories. My own stories, via the blog here, but also other kinds of stories through photography and design.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Here, I've aimed to mix business and pleasure, combining freelance design work with personal reflections. Take a look at my designs by viewing my portfolio, or read my posts on life, travel, what I'm reading, and more by visiting the blog. And, of course, I hope you'll contact me if you like what you see. I'd love to help you share your story, too.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
					<br>
					<p>xx Sarah</p>
